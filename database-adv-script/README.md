# ALX Airbnb Database: Advanced Querying & Optimization

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on advanced SQL querying and optimization. You'll tackle real-world challenges such as optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and applying indexing and partitioning to a simulated Airbnb database. The goal is to equip you with hands-on experience in database management and performance tuning for large-scale applications.

## Learning Objectives

- **Master Advanced SQL:** Write complex queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Optimize Query Performance:** Refactor SQL scripts using tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.
- **Implement Indexing & Partitioning:** Apply indexing and table partitioning for large datasets.
- **Monitor & Refine Performance:** Continuously monitor and refine database schemas and queries.
- **Think Like a DBA:** Make data-driven decisions for high-volume applications.

---

## Requirements

- Solid understanding of SQL basics (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`)
- Familiarity with relational database concepts (primary/foreign keys, normalization)
- Basic knowledge of performance tools (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`)
- Ability to manage a GitHub repository

## Key Highlights

1. **ER Diagrams:** Model relationships between users, bookings, properties, and reviews.
2. **Complex Joins:** Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` for data extraction.
3. **Subqueries:** Write correlated and non-correlated subqueries for advanced analysis.
4. **Aggregations & Window Functions:** Use `COUNT`, `SUM`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, etc.
5. **Indexing:** Identify bottlenecks and create indexes to improve performance.
6. **Query Optimization:** Refactor queries for efficiency using indexing and best practices.
7. **Partitioning:** Implement table partitioning for large datasets (e.g., bookings by date).
8. **Performance Monitoring:** Use `SHOW PROFILE`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, and schema refinement.

## Tasks Overview

- **Joins:** Write queries using different types of joins (`joins_queries.sql`)
- **Subqueries:** Practice correlated and non-correlated subqueries (`subqueries.sql`)
- **Aggregations & Window Functions:** Analyze data with advanced SQL (`aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`)
- **Indexing:** Create indexes and measure performance (`database_index.sql`, `index_performance.md`)
- **Query Optimization:** Refactor and analyze complex queries (`perfomance.sql`, `optimization_report.md`)
- **Partitioning:** Partition large tables and report improvements (`partitioning.sql`, `partition_performance.md`)
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor and refine database performance (`performance_monitoring.md`)
