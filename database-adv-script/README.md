# ALX Airbnb Database - Advanced Querying Module

## Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module focused on implementing advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques. Through hands-on experience with a simulated Airbnb database, you'll master database management and performance tuning essential for large-scale applications.


## Learning Objectives

- **Master Advanced SQL**: Write complex queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- **Optimize Query Performance**: Use EXPLAIN and ANALYZE for performance analysis
- **Implement Indexing & Partitioning**: Apply optimization techniques for large datasets
- **Monitor Database Performance**: Continuously refine schemas and queries
- **Think Like a DBA**: Make data-driven optimization decisions

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins
Write queries using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to retrieve bookings, users, properties, and reviews.

### Task 1: Subqueries Practice
Implement both correlated and non-correlated subqueries for advanced data analysis.

### Task 2: Aggregations and Window Functions
Use COUNT, SUM, ROW_NUMBER, and RANK functions for data analysis and ranking.

### Task 3: Database Indexing
Identify performance bottlenecks and create indexes for optimization.

### Task 4: Query Optimization
Refactor complex queries to improve execution performance.

### Task 5: Table Partitioning
Implement partitioning on large tables to optimize query performance.

### Task 6: Performance Monitoring
Use monitoring tools to identify and resolve performance issues.

### Task 7: Manual Review
Submit project for peer and instructor review.
