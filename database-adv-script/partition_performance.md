# Table Partitioning Performance Report

## Introduction
This document analyzes the performance impact of partitioning the Bookings table by the start_date column. Partitioning is a database optimization technique that divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces while maintaining the same logical structure.

## Implementation Details

### Partitioning Strategy
The Bookings table was partitioned by range on the start_date column with the following partitions:
- bookings_2022: Bookings from 2022
- bookings_2023: Bookings from 2023  
- bookings_2024: Bookings from 2024
- bookings_2025: Bookings from 2025
- bookings_future: All future bookings

### Indexing
Appropriate indexes were created on the partitioned table to maintain query performance:
- user_id for user-based queries
- property_id for property-based queries
- status for filtering by booking status

## Performance Testing

### Test Query
We tested a common query pattern: retrieving bookings for a specific date range.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Bookings_partitioned
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2023-06-01' AND '2023-06-30';
